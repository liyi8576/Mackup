> Cerebro plugin for searching on [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)

![](demo.gif)

## Features

* Search on your local tldr-pages repo.
* Shortcuts for tldr-pages repo (local and GitHub), tldr-pages web client and more.
* It will only allow to search for pages / commands available on your OS.
* TLDR Pages are cached for 24h in cerebro

## Usage and Requirements

* This plugin requires you to have cloned [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) somewhere into your machine. (By default, this plugin will expect the tldr repo to be found on $HOME/tldr)
* The path for the cloned repo folder should be configured on Plugin settings before usage. 
* By default, the plugin is expected the tldr-pages repo to live on $HOME/tldr.

**Note** The settings section is not tested and are broken on currently Cerebro release. If you want to use tldr from a different location than the default, you
can try running cerebro "master" branch. Sorry for the inconvinience.

## Supported Platforms

* This plugin was only tested on Linux but it should work fine in MacOS. 
* It is not compatible on Windows, since tldr-pages dont have any Windows commands yet.

## Knwon issues

* Open the tldr repo folder locally is not working ATM.

## Future improvements

* Be able to update the tldr pages directly from cerebro.
